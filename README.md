# SASS WATCHER POC

üì° Simple SASS watcher without anything else than your terminal üíª

This is a simple POC to show how to get a custom SASS watcher running in your web project.

## Requirements

- Node JS (v10+)
- Yarn

## Installation

* You don't need to install anything in your project if you already have installed SASS globally on your computer.
Like `yarn global add sass`.<br />
If not, you still can do it üòÅ!

* If ever you don't want to install SASS globally, you can just install this project's dependencies doing `yarn install`

This will install SASS in the project's `node_modules` folder.

## Launch watcher

**At root of project, launch:**

**```yarn watch```**

Note that compiled _CSS won't be compressed_ with this command.

## Production build

The built version can be compiled simply doing **`yarn build`**.
The compiled CSS file will be compressed.
